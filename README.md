# CL-Codes

Master's intership research project with Gilles Zemor (Bordeaux IMB),
The goal was to use a technique called Pellikaan decoding to build small binary codes that can correct errors beyond their minimal distance.
Slides and report are joined, if you ever have any use of this and some of it is unclear, feel free to contact me.
